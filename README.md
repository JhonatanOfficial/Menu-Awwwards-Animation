## Description
I created an animated menu inspired by the design showcased on [Pranav Suresh's website](https://www.pranavsuresh.com/) featured on [Awwwards](https://Awwwards.com). The menu incorporates smooth transitions and engaging animations, enhancing the user experience and providing a modern aesthetic.
